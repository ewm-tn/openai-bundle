## ðŸ“¦ Installation

1. Install the bundle via Composer:
   ```bash

2. Add the necessary environment variables to your `.env` file:

   Before using the bundle, ensure that the following environment variables are added to your `.env` file:

   - **`HOSTNAME`**: The public URL or hostname of your website. This variable defines the base URL from which the bundle can access resources, such as images.

     Example:
     ```dotenv
     HOSTNAME=https://example.com
     ```

   - **`OPEN_API_KEY`**: The API key required to authenticate your requests to the OpenAI service. You can generate and obtain this key directly from your OpenAI account.

     Example:
     ```dotenv
     OPEN_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
     ```

   **Example `.env` file:**
   ```dotenv
   # OpenAI API Configuration
   HOSTNAME=https://example.com
   OPEN_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
